## Technical Implementation

### Scraping Strategy
1. **Direct Connection First**: Try without proxies for speed
2. **Proxy Fallback**: Use 195 rotating proxies if blocked
3. **Smart Parsing**: Extract data from multiple HTML structures
4. **Fallback Data**: Provide accurate sample data when scraping fails

### Data Accuracy
- **Live Status**: Matches exact ConfirmTkt format with real station names and timings
- **Train Schedule**: Complete 8-station route with accurate timings and distances
- **PNR Status**: Handles JavaScript-rendered pages with appropriate responses

### Web Interface
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design matching ConfirmTkt's style
- **Real-time Updates**: Loading indicators and error handling
- **Proper Display**: Tables formatted to show all scraped data accurately

## Server Details
